WeatherPy: Weather data for 500+ cities was collected using the OpenWeatherMap API and citipy. Scatter plots and linear regression were used to explore relationships between weather and latitude.
VacationPy: Ideal vacation spots were found based on weather criteria, and the Geoapify API was used to locate nearby hotels, displayed on an interactive map.
My analysis showed higher temperatures near the equator and how Python and APIs can help with tasks like vacation planning.
